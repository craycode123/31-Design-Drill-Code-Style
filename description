We will now take a short break from writing code. Let’s learn how to style our code so it is clean, organized, and follow a set of grammatical and syntactic conventions. 

Every programmer has their own preferred way of writing code, but the best programmers will utilize (and perhaps even contribute to) the accepted standard for a given language, framework, or Domain Specific Language (DSL).

There are plenty of style guides for Ruby. Any piece of software (open source or proprietary) should use a style guide. It doesn’t really matter which one, so long as everyone working on the team follows it. 

The example code in this challenge is extremely messy. Using the conventions defined in this Ruby Style Guide, clean up the code. 

In particular, make sure to read the sections on Naming, Comments, and Source Code Layout.

You can rewrite the program any way you desire, so long as you don’t break the driver code (i.e. if you run the program, it should print all true).

Implement style consistency 
Clean up the code in the program using the conventions outlined in @bbatsov’s Ruby Style Guide.

Make sure that the code still works! You are just adding a fresh layer of paint to the walls, not tearing them down. 

Note: in your future challenges, start writing your code using the conventions that you have learnt. The more you practise, the more it becomes natural and easier.
